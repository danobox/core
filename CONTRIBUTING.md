# Contributing to μBox

Microbox (aka µbox, mu-box, or mi-box, depending on who you talk to) is an open source "fork" of Nanobox, focusing initially on feature-parity with Nanobox v1 (boxfiles), then on adding features and maintaining the boxfile approach moving forward. 

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution process easy and effective for everyone involved.

## Contributions

Contributions to Microbox should be made in the form of GitHub pull requests. Each pull request will be reviewed by a member of the core team and should target the relevant working branch for the version being currently developed. No contributions will be accepted if they do not come in the form of a pull request.

## Questions & Support

We use the GitHub issues for tracking bugs and feature requests and have limited bandwidth to address all of them. Thus we only accept bug reports, new feature requests and pull requests in GitHub. 

## Pull Request Checklist

* Do not submit your pull requests to the `master` branch. Branch from the required branch and, if needed, rebase to the proper branch before submitting your pull request. 
* Do not put submodule updates in your pull request unless a core member has approved it
* Add tests relevant to the fixed bug or new feature. 

## Requesting Features

If you have a change or new feature in mind, please open an issue in Github.
